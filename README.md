# ZMO - An interactive vole machine simulator made with C++ Qt6
A vole machine is a small machine that's made for educational purposes to help students understand how the computer works and how the instructions are executed. The machine has 256 memory cells and 16 registers. The machine has 13 instructions that it can execute. The machine has a program counter that points to the current instruction thatâ€™s about to be executed. The machine has an instruction register that holds the current instruction thatâ€™s about

make
./vole
```
4. Enjoy using the software
# Key features
- Simple friendly easy to use UI.
- When holding on any key or highlighted item it shows you a tooltip for it.
- You can add instructions manually or by loading a file.
- You can see the memory/register data all the time and keep tracking their values.
- You can see the output as ASCII characters. The output is took from the first 6 cells in the memory.
- You can halt/completely end the program whenever you want.
- You can clear all the progress you done in the machine.
- You can clear all the memory cells with one click.
- You can rerun the last program you added.
- You can execute instructions one by one or by launching the whole program to execute them automatically. You can also change the speed of running.
- There always a guide there explaining the instruction thatâ€™s about to be executed.
- There is a guide to show you all the operation codes you can use thatâ€™s the vole machine understand. ( They are shorted to make it nicer for the UI).
- You can always see the current program counter and the instruction register to keep tracking the execution.
- ZMO is out there greeting you and be with you reacting to all your actions you must try playing with him yourself.
- The memory table shows you the current cells where the program counter is pointing to.
- The memory table highlight the screen cells.
- You can go forward or backward in running the application.
